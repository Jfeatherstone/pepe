def spatialClusterLabels(points, l=.001):
    """
    Partition a set of points in clusters, and return the
    cluster label for each point.

    Method is very simplistic: the neighbors (points within
    a threshold distance) of a point are added to the same
    cluster, and the process is repeated until no points
    remain. This means that the size of clusters can be
    larger than this distance threshold (eg. think of a
    chain of points).

    Parameters
    ----------
    points : numpy.ndarray[N,d]
        Array of N points in d-dimensions

    l : float
        Distance threshold to consider two points as being in the
        same cluster. Given as fraction of the total system size.
        
    Returns
    -------
    labels : numpy.ndarray[N]
        Array of N labels (integers) denoting cluster
        assignment. Total number of clusters will be `max(labels)+1`.
