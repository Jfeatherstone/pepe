    """
    Calculate the approximate forces on each particle based on the photoelastic response.
    No optimization/gradient descent is done in this method; this should be used either where
    rough estimates of the forces are fine, or as an initial condition for a fitting function.

    Heavily based on James Puckett's PhD thesis (2012) and Jonathan Kollmer's PeGS:
    https://github.com/jekollmer/PEGS

    Daniels, K. E., Kollmer, J. E., & Puckett, J. G. (2017). Photoelastic force
    measurements in granular materials. Review of Scientific Instruments, 88(5),
    051808. https://doi.org/10.1063/1.4983049

    Outline of the process:

    0. Track particles to get centers and radii (external)
    1. Calculate average gradient squared for each particle
    2. Find which particles are in contact with each other
    3. Determine if there are any boundary contacts (optional)
    4. Calculate the position of each (boundary or interparticle) force for each particle
    5. Use the average gradient from step 1 to estimate the magnitude of force at each position

    Intended to be used as the initial condition for optimization process; see
    `pepe.analysis.forceOptimize()` for more information.

    When significant noise is present in the images, this method will often way overestimate
    the magnitudes of forces (because it is based on the gradient squared). If the guesses
    are much too high, it can be better to just set all force magnitudes to a reasonable
    flat value, like `.1`.

    Parameters
    ----------

    photelasticSingleChannel : np.uint8[H,W]
        A single channel image in array form of the photoelastic response of particles.

    centers : np.ndarray[N,2] 
        A list of N centers of format [y, x].

    radii : np.ndarray[N]
        A list of N radii, corresponding to each particle center

    contactPadding : int
        Maximum difference between distance and sum of radii for which
        two particles will still be considered in contact.

    g2EdgePadding : int or float
        Number of pixels to ignore at the edge of each particle when calculating the average
        G^2. If float value < 1 is passed, gradient mask radius will be taken as that percent
        of the full particle radius. A value of 0 means no padding is included.

    contactG2Threshold : float
        The neighbor weight value under which edges will be removed from the network,
        as they would be considered to weak to represent anything physical. This will
        help remove particle neighbors that are only barely touching, but not transmitting
        any real force.

    contactMaskRadius : float
        The radius of the circular mask applied over a contact to estimate the magnitude
        of the force there. Should be smaller than the radius, usually 25% of the radius is fine.
        For higher forces, larger mask may be needed.

    neightborEvaluations : int
        How many of the closest points to find via the kd tree and test
        as potential contacts. For homogeneous circles, or approximately
        homogenous (< 2:1 size ratio), 4 should be plenty.

    boundaryMask : np.uint8[H,W]
        Optional mask removing uneccesary parts of the image, that is used
        to detect boundaries. Locations with a value of 0 will be assumed to be
        solid walls, that a particle could potentially be in contact with. If
        not provided, or set to None, system will be assumed to be in a rectangular
        box defined the most extreme top/bottom/left/right particles.

    ignoreBoundary : bool
        Whether to not attempt to find any contacts with the boundary. This will take effect
        regardless of whether a boundary mask is passed as a parameter.

    brightfield : bool
        Whether the photoelastic response is seen through a brightfield (True)
        polariscope or darkfield (False) polariscope.

    boundaryDetectionOptions : kwargs
        Dictionary of kwargs to be passed to the detectWallContact method, assuming
        boundaries are being included in the solver. If none are provided, relevant
        values are carried over from the kwargs for this method (`contactPadding`, 
        `g2EdgePadding`, `contactMaskRadius`, `contactG2Threshold`).

    g2Cal : float
        Gradient squared to force calibration value. For numerous calls of the
        function, it is recommended to calculate this value once externally,
        and pass it in. If left as None, will be recalculated internally.


    Returns
    -------

    forceGuessArr : np.object[N,F(N)]
        Triangular array of force magnitude guesses for N particles with F(N) forces each
        (could be different number of forces per particle).

    alphaGuessArr : np.object[N,F(N)]
        Triangular array of alpha angle guesses for N particles with F(N) forces each
        (could be different number of forces per particle).

    betaGuessArr : np.object[N,F(N)]
        Triangular array of beta angle guesses for N particles with F(N) forces each

    """
    Optimize an initial guess for the forces acting on a particle using
    a nonlinear minimization function.

    Parameters
    ----------

    forceGuessArr : np.ndarray[Z]
        The initial guess for magnitudes of each force that is acting on the particle.

    betaGuessArr : np.ndarray[Z]
        The initial guess for the positional angles where each force is acting (in radians).

    alphaGuessArr : np.ndarray[Z]
        The initial guess for the directional angles for each force acting on the particle (in radians).

    radius : float
        The radius of the particle, in pixels.

    center : [int, int]
        The coordinates of the center, [y,x], of the particle.

    realImage : np.ndarray[H,W]
        The photoelastic channel that the optimizer will compare against. Can be a composite image
        include other particles, since a mask will be applied around the given particle.

    parametersToFit : ['f'[[, 'b'], 'a']]
        Which parameters should be allowed to be varied in the process of minimizing the function; 'f' for
        force magnitude, 'b' for beta positional angle, 'a' for alpha directional angle. Must include at least one.

        Can also specify to perform multiple optimizations on different variables by providing a 2D list of
        parameters keys (any of 'f', 'a', 'b') e.g. [ ['f', 'b'], ['f', 'a'] ] will first optimize the force
        and beta values, then optimize the force and alpha values. When performing multiple optimizations,
        the result of the previous one is used as initial condition for the following one, though the residual
        array includes information about all optimizations. 

        Values for `maxEvals`, `forceTol`, `betaTol`, `alphaTol`, and `method` can be provided as lists of
        acceptable values to specify different options for each optimization e.g. `method=['nelder', 'cobyla']`
        will use the Nelder-Mead optimization scheme on the first pass, and then COBYLA on the second one. If
        a single value is provided for any of these parameters, that will be used for all optimizations.

    method : str
        The method to use for optimization. See wiki page on Force Solver for more information on selecting
        an appropriate one. Generally any method from [lmfit](https://lmfit.github.io/lmfit-py/fitting.html#the-minimize-function)
        can be used, but the following tend to give the best results:

        - `lm` - Levenberg-Marquardt

        - `least_squares` - Trust region reflective

        - `nelder` - Nelder-Mead

        Can be provided as a list of values when performing multiple optimizations; see `parametersToFit`.

    maxEvals : int
        The maximum number of function evaluations before the minimizer exits. Convergence can occur before
        this number of evaluations, but process will be interrupted at this value regardless of whether
        or not the result has converged.

        Can be provided as a list of values when performing multiple optimizations; see `parametersToFit`.

    forceBounds : (float, float)
        The upper and lower limits for the values of force magnitudes that the minimizer can explore, 
        assuming that `useTolerance` is set to False.

    betaBounds : (float, float)
        The upper and lower limits for the values of beta that the minimizer can explore, 
        assuming that `useTolerance` is set to False.

    alphaBounds : (float, float)
        The upper and lower limits for the values of alpha that the minimizer can explore, 
        assuming that `useTolerance` is set to False.

    forceTolerance : float
        If `useTolerance` is set to True, this value will be used to calculate the bounds for each
        force individually, as the initial value minus this tolerance, and the initial value plus
        this tolerance.

        Can be provided as a list of values when performing multiple optimizations; see `parametersToFit`.

    betaTolerance : float
        If `useTolerance` is set to True, this value will be used to calculate the bounds for each
        beta individually, as the initial value minus this tolerance, and the initial value plus
        this tolerance.

        Can be provided as a list of values when performing multiple optimizations; see `parametersToFit`.

    alphaTolerance : float
        If `useTolerance` is set to True, this value will be used to calculate the bounds for each
        alpha individually, as the initial value minus this tolerance, and the initial value plus
        this tolerance.

        Can be provided as a list of values when performing multiple optimizations; see `parametersToFit`.

    useTolerance : bool
        Whether to calculate the bounds for each parameters as the initial value plus/minus a
        certain tolerance (True) or to use the set intervals provided via the `forceBounds`, 
        `betaBounds`, and `alphaBounds` parameters (False).

    returnOptResult : bool
        Whether to return the optimizer result object, which includes all parameters values and
        potentially uncertainties (True) or just the optimized values of the forces, betas, alphas,
        and residuals (False). Note that if multiple optimizations are being performed, only the
        final result object will be returned.
    
    allowAddForces : bool
        Whether or not to allow the optimization routine to attempt to detect missing forces,
        and add them in. This detection is done by examining the gradient squared of the 
        photoelastic image provided to the method (`realImage`). If a force is added, the
        last optimization routine will be run again, with the added ability to vary the
        contact position, beta (if this was not already the case).

    allowRemoveForces : bool
        Whether or not to allow the optimization routine to remove forces that have a
        magnitude below a certain threshold (see `minForceThreshold`).

    minForceThreshold : float
        The minimizer will automatically remove any forces whose magnitude is lower than
        this value between fittings and after the final one.

    contactMaskRadius : float
        The radius in pixels of the circular mask applied over contacts, either during localized
        alpha optimization (see `localizeAlphaOptimization`) or detection of missing
        contacts (see `allowAddForces`).
    
    newBetaMinSeparation : float
        The minimum separation for a potential new contact (see `allowAddForces`) to be
        considered as a real force to be added. Larger values can prevent doubling up
        on forces, when there is really only a single, extended contact point

    newBetaG2Height : float
        The threshold for average gradient squared value in a localized region around
        a potential new contact.

    missingForceChiSqrThreshold : float
        The minimum chi squared value (as calculated by the optimization routine; analagous to error)
        above which the method will attempt to detect missing forces.

        Found by experimentation.

    localizeAlphaOptimization : bool
        When optimizing for the incident angle (alpha) alone, the effect of varying
        this value can be very subtle across the entire particle. This parameter will have
        the largest effect in a small region around the contact. If this value is `True`, 
        optimizations only for alpha (done by passing `parametersToFit=['a']`, or similar)
        will mask the particle except for a small region around the contact.

    imageScaleFactor : int > 1 or positive float < 1
       Factor by which to scale the real image when optimizating. Integer larger than 1 will
       lead to the image being upsampled, and float less than 1 (but greater than 0) will lead
       to the image being downsampled.

       Must lead to an integer up- or downscale factor; for upscaling this is not an issue, but
       downscale factors may be rounded in not the exact inverse of an integer. eg. a value of `.35`
       will result in a downscale by a factor of 3, not 2.85.

    forceBalanceWeighting : float
        If set to some non-zero and non-None value, the optimization cost will include a
        contribution depending on how badly the ensemble of forces satisfy force balance.

    debug : bool
        Whether or not to print out status statements as the optimization is performed.

        Array of angles representing force contact positions.

    Detect potential particle contacts with the wall.

    Parameters
    ----------

    centers : np.ndarray[N,2] 
        A list of N centers of format [y, x].

    radii : np.ndarray[N]
        A list of N radii, corresponding to each particle center

    boundaryMask : np.uint8[H,W]
        Mask removing uneccesary parts of the image, that is used
        to detect boundaries. Locations with a value of 0 will be assumed to be
        solid walls, that a particle could potentially be in contact with.

    photelasticSingleChannel : np.uint8[H,W]
        A single channel image in array form of the photoelastic response of particles.
        Is used to determine if a contact is actually force bearing or not. If not 
        provided, all potential contacts will be returned.

    contactPadding : int
        Maximum difference between distance between a particle's edge and the wall
        that will still be tested as a wall contact.

    g2EdgePadding : int or float
        Number of pixels to ignore at the edge of each particle when calculating the average
        G^2. If float value < 1 is passed, gradient mask radius will be taken as that percent
        of the full particle radius. A value of 0 means no padding is included.

    contactG2Threshold : float
        The neighbor weight value under which edges will be removed from the network,
        as they would be considered to weak to represent anything physical. This will
        help remove particle neighbors that are only barely touching, but not transmitting
        any real force.

    angleClusterThreshold : float
        The minimum difference in consecutive angle (beta) for which two wall contacts
        will be considered unique (and not merged into the same contact).

    contactMaskRadius : int
        The size of the circular mask that is used to determine average gradient squared
        value around detected contacts.

    extendedContacts : bool
        Whether or not to break up larger potential contacts in multiple. See `maxContactExtent`.

    maxContactExtent : float
        The maximum range of angles that can be included in a single cluster. If any particular
        cluster exceeds this value, it will be divided up into multiple new clusters.

    Returns
    -------

    numWallContacts : np.ndarray[N]
        The number of wall contacts for each particle (denoted as Z_i in other return values).
    
    betaArr : np.ndarray[N, Z_i]
        A list of angles for each particle in which there likely is a wall contact.

    contactG2Arr : np.ndarray[N, Z_i]
        A list of average gradient squared values for each wall contact, to be
        multiplied by the g2 calibration value to get the initial force magnitude guess.
