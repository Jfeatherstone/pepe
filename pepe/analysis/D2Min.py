Modifications include more documentation, change of notation,
and change from bond-focused calculation to center-focused
calculation (see code for more details).

def calculateD2Min(initialCenters, finalCenters, refParticleIndex=0, interactionRadius=None, interactionNeighbors=None, normalize=True):
    """
    Calculate the d2min between an initial and final state of particles;
    a measure of how non-affine the transformation is, as originally described
    in [1].

    
    Parameters
    ----------

    initialCenters : np.ndarray[N,d] or list
        List of initial center points of N particles in d dimensions.

    finalCenters :  np.ndarray[N,d] or list
        List of final center points of N particles in d dimensions. Must be
        in the same order as initialCenters.

    refParticleIndex : int
        The index of the particle to treat as the reference particle (r_0 in Falk & Langer
        1998 eq. 2.11). If set to None, will calculate the D2min N times using each particle
        as the reference (and return types will have an extra first dimension N). Simiarly, can
        be a list of indices for which to calculate as the refernce indices.

    interactionRadius : float
        The maximum distance between particles that can be considered neighbors. Recommended to
        be set to around 1.1 - 1.5 times the mean particle radius of the system.

        If set to None, all other particles in the system will be considered neighbors. See interactionNeighbors
        for specifying a fixed number of neighbors. In the case that neither a radius or number of
        neighbors are specified, calculation will default to using all other particles as neighbors.

    interactionNeighbors : int
        As opposed to using an interactionRadius to define neighbors, a fixed number of neighbors can
        be specified here. This number of neighbors will be found using a kd-tree for the reference point(s).

        In the case that neither a radius or number of neighbors are specified, calculation will default
        to using all other particles as neighbors.

    normalize : bool
        Whether to divide the d2min by the number of neighbors used to calculate it (True) or not (False).
        For heterogeneous systems where the number of neighbors can vary significantly, recommend to set True.
        Will make little difference if a fixed number of neighbors (see interactionNeigbors) are used.

    Returns
    -------

    d2min : float
        The minimum value of D2 for the transition from the initial to final state. Units
        are a squared distance dimensionally the same as the initial and final centers (likely
        a pixel^2 value if tracked from images). Changing units to particle diameters afterwards
        may be necessary.

    epsilon : numpy.ndarray[d,d]
        The uniform strain tensor that minimizes D2; equation 2.14 in [1].


    In the case that `refParticleIndex=None`, the return will instead be a tuple of numpy arrays
    containing the same information but for every particle:

    d2minArr : np.ndarray[N]
        The minimum value of D2 for the transition from the initial to final state for
        every possible configuration.

    epsilonArr : np.ndarray[N,d,d]
        The uniform strain tensor that minimizes D2 for every possible configuration
