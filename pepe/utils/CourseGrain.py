def courseGrainField(points, values=None, defaultValue=0, latticeSpacing=None, fixedBounds=None, kernel='gaussian', kernelSize=5, subsample=None, returnSpacing=False, returnCorner=False):
    """
    Course grains a collection of values at arbitrary points,
    into a discrete field.

    If `values=None`, course-grained field is the point density.

    Parameters
    ----------
    points : numpy.ndarray[N,d]
        Spatial positions of N points in d-dimensional space.

    values : numpy.ndarray[N,[k]] or func(points)->numpy.ndarray[N,[k]] or None
        Field values at each point. Can be k-dimensional vector,
        resulting in k course-grained fields.

        Can also be a (vectorized) function that returns a value given
        a collection of points. eg. neighbor counting function. This
        functionality is provided such that if the function is computationally
        expensive, eg. neighbor counting, the points can be subdivided into
        batches and the course grained fields can be summed at the end. This
        is a way to approximate the course grained field for a huge (>1e6)
        number of points, while still remaining computationally feasible.
        See `subsample`.

        If `None`, returned field will be the point density.

    defaultValue : float or numpy.ndarray[k]
        The default value of the course-grained field;
        probably `0` for most applications.

    latticeSpacing : float or None
        The spacing of lattice points for the course-grained field.

        If `None`, will be chosen such that the largest-spanning axis
        has 100 lattice points, with other axes using the same spacing.

    fixedBounds : numpy.ndarray[d] or None
        The bounds of the field to define the discretized
        grid over. If None, will be calculated based on the
        extrema of the provided points.

    kernel : str or numpy.ndarray[A,A]
        The kernel to course-grain the field with. 'gaussian'
        option is implemented as default, but a custom matrix
        can be provided. If using default gaussian option,
        kernel size can be set with `kernelSize`.

    kernelSize : int
        The kernel size to use if `kernel='gaussian'`.
        If a custom kernel is provided, this has no effect.
