# Photoelastic Python Environment

<u>P</u>hoto-
<u>e</u>lastic
<u>P</u>ython
<u>E</u>nvironment

This is a collection of tools for working with photoelastic particle images, including common analysis methods like particle tracking and community analysis.

## Features

- Common analysis techniques (G<sup>2</sup>, D<sup>2</sup>min, etc.)
- Particle tracking
- Masking and other preprocessing tools
- Synthetic photoelastic response generation
- Force solving (as in PeGS [1a, 1b])

## Installation

The library is available on PyPi:

```
pip install pepe-granular
```

It can also be installed from the Github repository:

```
git clone https://github.com/Jfeatherstone/pepe
cd pepe
pip install .
```

## Documentation

Available [here](http://jfeatherstone.github.io/pepe/pepe).

## Requirements

Python 3.11 is the recommended version to use, with the following packages:

- [numpy](https://numpy.org/)
- [matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/)
- [lmfit](https://lmfit.github.io/lmfit-py/index.html)
- [scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/)
- [opencv](https://opencv.org/)
- [Pillow](https://pillow.readthedocs.io/en/stable/)
- [numba](https://numba.pydata.org/)
- [tqdm](https://github.com/tqdm/tqdm)

These can all be installed (alongside their dependencies) via `pip`:
```
git clone https://github.com/jfeatherstone/pepe
cd pepe
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

The [wiki](https://github.com/Jfeatherstone/pepe/wiki) and [documentation](http://jfeatherstone.github.io/pepe/pepe) contain information about how to use the toolbox. Test notebooks can be
found in the repo's [`notebooks`](https://github.com/Jfeatherstone/pepe/tree/master/tests) directory, and unit tests can be found in the `pepe.test` directory.

Some of the test notebooks make use of the Matlab API to compare against Jonathan Kollmer's code [1a], but this is not required to use any functions in the library itself. Installing the Matlab API requires a local installation of Matlab proper; see [here](https://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/matlab_external/install-the-matlab-engine-for-python.html) for more information.
