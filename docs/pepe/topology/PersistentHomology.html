def _iterNeighbors(p, tShape, neighborInclusion=1):
    &#34;&#34;&#34;
    Find the indices of all neighbors of an `d`-dimensional point.

    Used primarily in `pepe.topology.multiFindPeaks()`.

    Parameters
    ----------

    p : tuple[d]
        A tuple of indices representing a point in $Z^d$.

    tShape : tuple[d]
        The size of the grid/tensor in each dimension, such that
        points outside of the domain can be removed.
    &#34;&#34;&#34;
    d = len(p)
    # Convert to numpy array to do math (which can&#39;t be done on tuples)
    nP = np.array(p, dtype=np.int16)

    # Result is just the difference vectors from our point to the neighbors
    # (eg. [-1, 0] or [1, 1]) so we need to add these to our original point.
    neighbors = [nP + np.array(n) for n in result]
    
    # This element will always be the original point because the ordering for arange is
    # consistent such that the difference vector of [0,0,0,...] will always be at the
    # center (even after permuting for arbitrary dimensions).

def findPeaksMulti(data, neighborInclusion=1, minPeakPrevalence=None, normalizePrevalence=True):
    &#34;&#34;&#34;
    Identify peaks in multi-dimensional data using persistent topology.

    Peak prevalence is calculated as the age of topological features,
    which is not necessarily the same as the actual height of the peaks.

    Originally adapted from [1] (and partially from [2]), but generalized for data with
    an arbitrary number of dimensions. For background on persistence, see: [3] for
    application of persistence to signal processing, or [4] for general domain knowledge
    (these are just my personal recommendations, probably plenty of other resources out there).

    May struggle to find peaks in noisier data if the fluctuations due to
    noise are large enough to create a spiky-looking profile. This is because
    such fluctuations do represent topological objects, even if they are not ones
    of any physical relevance; this method does not distinguish between the two.
    In this case, smoothing functions are recommended to be used on the data before
    it is passed to this method. A higher `neighborInclusion` can partially address this.

    Method is not able to be optimized using `numba` (mostly due to the use of tuples,
    which `numba` can&#39;t type as easily as a list or array. While this method can identify
    peaks in 1D or 2D data, it is recommended to instead use either `pepe.topology.findPeaks1D()`
    or `pepe.topology.findPeaks2D()`, as these *are* optimized.

    Parameters
    ----------

    data : np.ndarray[d]
        An array of data points within which to identify peaks in d-dimensional space.

    neighborInclusion : int
        Controls the number of neighbors on either side of a point to look
        at when deciding which peak a given point belongs to. 

        eg. In 1D, a value of `1` means that `[i-1, i+1]` are considered neighbors,
        a value of `2` means that `[i-2, i-1, i+1, i+1]` are considered neighbors, etc.

        May help to supress the effects of noise in data, but should not be treated
        as a substitute for smoothing data properly beforehand.

    minPeakPrevalence : float or None
        The minimum prevalence of a peak (maximum - minimum) that will be
        returned to the user. If `normalizePrevalence` is True, this should
        be in the range `[0, 1]`, representing a percentage of the full range
        the data occupies.

    normalizePrevalence : bool
        Whether to normalize the prevalences such that they represent the
        percent of the data range that is spanned by a peak (True) or not (False).
        For example, if normalized, a prevalence of .4 would mean that the peak
        spans 40% of the total range of the data.

        Note that this normalization happens before using the minPeakPrevalence
        kwarg to clip smaller peaks, and thus the minimum value should be
        specified as a percent (eg. .3 for 30%) is the normalizePrevalence
        kwarg is True.

    Returns
    -------

    peakPositions : np.ndarray[N,d]
        The indices of peaks in the provided data, sorted from most
        to least prevalent (persistent).

    peakPrevalences : np.ndarray[N]
        The prevalence of each peak in the provided data, or the persistence
        of the topological feature. If `normalizePrevalence` is True, this will
        be normalized to the domain `[0, 1]`; otherwise, these values are
        equivalent to the maximum data value minus the minimum data value evaluated
        over all points that identify with a given peak.

def findPeaks1D(data, minPeakPrevalence=None, normalizePrevalence=True):
    &#34;&#34;&#34;
    Find peaks in one dimensional data using persistent homology.

    Peak prevalence is calculated as the age of topological features,
    which is not necessarily the same as the actual height of the peaks.

    Originally adapted from [1], with changes mostly pertaining to readability and 
    stronger emphasis on efficiency. For background on persistence, see: [2] for
    application of persistence to signal processing, or [3] for general domain knowledge.

    May struggle to find peaks in noisier data if the fluctuations due to
    noise are large enough to create a spiky-looking profile. This is because
    such fluctuations do represent topological objects, even if they are not ones
    of any physical relevance; this method does not distinguish between the two.
    In this case, smoothing functions are recommended to be used on the data before
    it is passed to this method.

    Parameters
    ----------

    data : np.ndarray
        An array of data points within which to identify peaks.

    minPeakPrevalence : float or None
        The minimum prevalence of a peak (maximum - minimum) that will be
        returned to the user. If `normalizePrevalence` is True, this should
        be in the range `[0, 1]`, representing a percentage of the full range
        the data occupies.

    normalizePrevalence : bool
        Whether to normalize the prevalences such that they represent the
        percent of the data range that is spanned by a peak (True) or not (False).
        For example, if normalized, a prevalence of .4 would mean that the peak
        spans 40% of the total range of the data.

        Note that this normalization happens before using the minPeakPrevalence
        kwarg to clip smaller peaks, and thus the minimum value should be
        specified as a percent (eg. .3 for 30%) is the normalizePrevalence
        kwarg is True.

    Returns
    -------

    peakPositions : np.ndarray[N]
        The indices of peaks in the provided data, sorted from most
        to least prevalent (persistent). If `returnValues` is True, this
        will instead be the values at these indices, or `data[peakPositions]`.

    peakPrevalences : np.ndarray[N]
        The prevalence of each peak in the provided data, or the persistence
        of the topological feature. If `normalizePrevalence` is True, this will
        be normalized to the domain `[0, 1]`; otherwise, these values are
        equivalent to the maximum data value minus the minimum data value evaluated
        over all points that identify with a given peak.

    Find peaks in one dimensional data using persistent homology.

    Peak prevalence is calculated as the age of topological features,
    which is not necessarily the same as the actual height of the peaks.

    Originally adapted from [1], with changes mostly pertaining to readability and 
    stronger emphasis on efficiency. For background on persistence, see: [2] for
    application of persistence to signal processing, or [3] for general domain knowledge.

    May struggle to find peaks in noisier data if the fluctuations due to
    noise are large enough to create a spiky-looking profile. This is because
    such fluctuations do represent topological objects, even if they are not ones
    of any physical relevance; this method does not distinguish between the two.
    In this case, smoothing functions are recommended to be used on the data before
    it is passed to this method.

    Parameters
    ----------

    data : np.ndarray
        An array of data points within which to identify peaks.

    minPeakPrevalence : float or None
        The minimum prevalence of a peak (maximum - minimum) that will be
        returned to the user. If `normalizePrevalence` is True, this should
        be in the range `[0, 1]`, representing a percentage of the full range
        the data occupies.

    normalizePrevalence : bool
        Whether to normalize the prevalences such that they represent the
        percent of the data range that is spanned by a peak (True) or not (False).
        For example, if normalized, a prevalence of .4 would mean that the peak
        spans 40% of the total range of the data.

        Note that this normalization happens before using the minPeakPrevalence
        kwarg to clip smaller peaks, and thus the minimum value should be
        specified as a percent (eg. .3 for 30%) is the normalizePrevalence
        kwarg is True.

    Returns
    -------

    peakPositions : np.ndarray[N]
        The indices of peaks in the provided data, sorted from most
        to least prevalent (persistent). If `returnValues` is True, this
        will instead be the values at these indices, or `data[peakPositions]`.

    peakPrevalences : np.ndarray[N]
        The prevalence of each peak in the provided data, or the persistence
        of the topological feature. If `normalizePrevalence` is True, this will
        be normalized to the domain `[0, 1]`; otherwise, these values are
        equivalent to the maximum data value minus the minimum data value evaluated
        over all points that identify with a given peak.

    Identify peaks in 2-dimensional data using persistent topology.

    Peak prevalence is calculated as the age of topological features,
    which is not necessarily the same as the actual height of the peaks.

    Originally adapted from [1] (and partially from [2]), but adjusted for data with
    an specifically 2 dimensions. For background on persistence, see: [3] for
    application of persistence to signal processing, or [4] for general domain knowledge
    (these are just my personal recommendations, probably plenty of other resources out there).

    May struggle to find peaks in noisier data if the fluctuations due to
    noise are large enough to create a spiky-looking profile. This is because
    such fluctuations do represent topological objects, even if they are not ones
    of any physical relevance; this method does not distinguish between the two.
    In this case, smoothing functions are recommended to be used on the data before
    it is passed to this method.

    Method is optimized using `numba`.

    Parameters
    ----------

    data : np.ndarray[d]
        An array of data points within which to identify peaks in d-dimensional space.

    minPeakPrevalence : float or None
        The minimum prevalence of a peak (maximum - minimum) that will be
        returned to the user. If `normalizePrevalence` is True, this should
        be in the range `[0, 1]`, representing a percentage of the full range
        the data occupies.

    normalizePrevalence : bool
        Whether to normalize the prevalences such that they represent the
        percent of the data range that is spanned by a peak (True) or not (False).
        For example, if normalized, a prevalence of .4 would mean that the peak
        spans 40% of the total range of the data.

        Note that this normalization happens before using the minPeakPrevalence
        kwarg to clip smaller peaks, and thus the minimum value should be
        specified as a percent (eg. .3 for 30%) is the normalizePrevalence
        kwarg is True.

    Returns
    -------

    peakPositions : np.ndarray[N,d]
        The indices of peaks in the provided data, sorted from most
        to least prevalent (persistent).

    peakPrevalences : np.ndarray[N]
        The prevalence of each peak in the provided data, or the persistence
        of the topological feature. If `normalizePrevalence` is True, this will
        be normalized to the domain `[0, 1]`; otherwise, these values are
        equivalent to the maximum data value minus the minimum data value evaluated
        over all points that identify with a given peak.

    Identify peaks in multi-dimensional data using persistent topology.

    Peak prevalence is calculated as the age of topological features,
    which is not necessarily the same as the actual height of the peaks.

    Originally adapted from [1] (and partially from [2]), but generalized for data with

    noise are large enough to create a spiky-looking profile. This is because
    such fluctuations do represent topological objects, even if they are not ones
    of any physical relevance; this method does not distinguish between the two.
    In this case, smoothing functions are recommended to be used on the data before
    it is passed to this method. A higher `neighborInclusion` can partially address this.

    Method is not able to be optimized using `numba` (mostly due to the use of tuples,
    which `numba` can&#39;t type as easily as a list or array. While this method can identify
    peaks in 1D or 2D data, it is recommended to instead use either `pepe.topology.findPeaks1D()`
    or `pepe.topology.findPeaks2D()`, as these *are* optimized.

    Parameters
    ----------

    data : np.ndarray[d]
        An array of data points within which to identify peaks in d-dimensional space.

    neighborInclusion : int
        Controls the number of neighbors on either side of a point to look
        at when deciding which peak a given point belongs to. 

        eg. In 1D, a value of `1` means that `[i-1, i+1]` are considered neighbors,
        a value of `2` means that `[i-2, i-1, i+1, i+1]` are considered neighbors, etc.

        May help to supress the effects of noise in data, but should not be treated
        as a substitute for smoothing data properly beforehand.

    minPeakPrevalence : float or None
        The minimum prevalence of a peak (maximum - minimum) that will be
        returned to the user. If `normalizePrevalence` is True, this should
        be in the range `[0, 1]`, representing a percentage of the full range
        the data occupies.

    normalizePrevalence : bool
        Whether to normalize the prevalences such that they represent the
        percent of the data range that is spanned by a peak (True) or not (False).
        For example, if normalized, a prevalence of .4 would mean that the peak
        spans 40% of the total range of the data.

        Note that this normalization happens before using the minPeakPrevalence
        kwarg to clip smaller peaks, and thus the minimum value should be
        specified as a percent (eg. .3 for 30%) is the normalizePrevalence
        kwarg is True.

    Returns
    -------

    peakPositions : np.ndarray[N,d]
        The indices of peaks in the provided data, sorted from most
        to least prevalent (persistent).

    peakPrevalences : np.ndarray[N]
        The prevalence of each peak in the provided data, or the persistence
        of the topological feature. If `normalizePrevalence` is True, this will
        be normalized to the domain `[0, 1]`; otherwise, these values are
        equivalent to the maximum data value minus the minimum data value evaluated
        over all points that identify with a given peak.
