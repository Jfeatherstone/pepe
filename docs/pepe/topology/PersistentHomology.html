def findPeaks(data, returnValues=False, minPeakPrevalence=None, normalizePrevalence=True):
    &#34;&#34;&#34;
    Find peaks in one dimensional data using persistent homology.

    Peak prevalence is calculated as the age of topological features.

    Parameters
    ----------

    data : np.ndarray
        An array of data points within which to identify peaks.

    returnValues : bool
        Whether to return the indices of maxima (False) or the values
        at those maxima (True).

    minPeakPrevalence : float or None
        The minimum prevalence of a peak (maximum - minimum) that will be
        returned to the user.

    normalizePrevalence : bool
        Whether to normalize the prevalences such that they represent the
        percent of the data range that is spanned by a peak (True) or not (False).
        For example, if normalized, a prevalence of .4 would mean that the peak
        spans 40% of the total range of the data.

        Note that this normalization happens before using the minPeakPrevalence
        kwarg to clip smaller peaks, and thus the minimum value should be
        specified as a percent (eg. .3 for 30%) is the normalizePrevalence
        kwarg is True.
