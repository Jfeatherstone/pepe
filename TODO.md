# TODO List

- Write up GenLouvain community detection algorithm
- Create some examples
- Create parameter choice help script/GUI
- Create pipeline for force solving
- Write method to calculate just beta contact angles (in place of `initialForceSolve`)
- Create method to generate lists of colors (that have at least some contrast)
- Write up list of code conventions for the library
- Make sure all methods follow said conventions
- Add gaussian fitting to refine convolutional circle detection
    - Check resolution by binning non-integer remainder
- Add radius variation to convolutional circle detection
- Implement faster method to track circles with convolution given initial guess of position
- Get force balance working, either as cost function or forcibly imposing on sets of forces
