## High priority

- Implement and test subpixel convolutional circle tracking

## Low priority

- Write up GenLouvain community detection algorithm
- Create some examples
- Create parameter choice help script/GUI
- Implement IWantHue color generation
- Write up list of code conventions for the library
- Make sure all methods follow said conventions
- Implement faster method to track circles with convolution given initial guess of position

## Bugs

- Force musical chairs
    - Forces will sometimes switch identities with each other, but otherwise maintaining consistency.
